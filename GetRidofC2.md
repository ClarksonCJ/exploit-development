# Python 3 encoding problems

Here I'm gonna say the solution to one of the python3 encoding problem (C2)

### Ok what's C2?

Here I've created an exploit with python3, but the exploit not working :/
Let's analyse this...

Our exploit not working coz we have C2 before every bytes, Python3 has some encoding issues we need to change something in this to encode it correctly.


### Same exploit on python2

See here python2 has no issues in this, however we can use python2 but I'm a user of python3 so it takes some extra time for me to code in python2.
Also I have issues in some python2 modules too :/


## FIX

Now here we're fixing the issue by specifying  `encode('latin-1')` and using `sys.stdout.buffer.write()` instead of print()

Coz print has some issues in this, It'll print the encoded payload within `b'  '` so our payload will be messed up :/

See now here no more c2 :)

I hope this will be helpful to you while doing binary exploitation :)
